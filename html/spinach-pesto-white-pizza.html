    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      When my kids were really small, they were reluctant to eat their veggies
      and I had to get creative. I figured that because pesto is already green,
      it would be the perfect place for some spinach. The pizza was a big hit.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups fresh baby spinach</li>
      <li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon prepared pesto, divided</li>
      <li>1 package (6 ounces) ready-to-use grilled chicken breast strips</li>
      <li>1 prebaked 12-inch pizza crust</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>5 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled</li>
      <li>1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450Â°. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high
        heat. Add spinach; cook and stir just until wilted. Remove from heat;
        stir in 1/4 cup pesto. In a small bowl, toss chicken with remaining
        pesto.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place crust on an ungreased baking sheet. Spread with spinach mixture;
        top with chicken, mozzarella cheese and bacon. Drop ricotta cheese by
        rounded teaspoonfuls over top; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake 8-10
        minutes or until cheese is melted.
      </li>
    </ol>
